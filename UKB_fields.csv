Assessment Centre > Verbal interview > Medical conditions,100074,20002,"Non-cancer illness code, self-reported",Categorical multiple,,6,"Code for non-cancer illness. If the participant was uncertain of the type of illness they had had, then they described it to the interviewer (a trained nurse) who attempted to place it within the coding tree. If the illness could not be located in the coding tree then the interviewer entered a free-text description of it. These free-text descriptions were subsequently examined by a doctor and, where possible, matched to entries in the coding tree. Free-text descriptions which could not be matched with very high probability have been marked as \""unclassifiable\"".   Note that myasthenia gravis appears twice (under codes 1260 and 1437). Please ensure you use both codes to capture all relevant diagnoses.",http://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/ukb/field.cgi?id=20002

Genomics > Genotypes > Genotyping process and sample QC,100313,22000,Genotype measurement batch,Categorical single,,22000,"Genotyping was done using two closely related arrays, referred to as the UK BiLEVE array and the UK Biobank Axiom array. The BiLEVE array was designed first and run on 50,000 participants. The UKB Axiom array was designed subsequently with a view to maximizing marker overlap as much as possible between the arrays and run on the remaining 450,000 participants. The UKB Axiom array had over 820,000 SNPs and indel markers, and the UK BiLEVE array was very similar with over 95% common content.   Samples were analysed in batches of approximately 4700 items. Interim results from first 33 batches (UKBiLEVE_b1-11 and Batch_b001-022) were released 18 months ahead of the remainder. The CEL files from these interim batches were subsequently re-analysed as part of the QC process for the full release, and this resulted in minor changes to the associated calls.",http://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/ukb/field.cgi?id=22000
Genomics > Genotypes > Genotyping process and sample QC,100313,22001,Genetic sex,Categorical single,,9,"Sex as determined from genotyping analysis.   In a small number (38) of cases the genetic sex currently listed differs from that calculated at the earlier 'Interim 150K' release. The new values are the result of re-genotyping these samples as they were felt to be of insufficient quality, and the genetic sex now agrees with the sex provided in Field 31 that was sourced from central registry at recruitment but was updated if the participant reported it was incorrect.   Note that in over 300 cases the genetic sex differs from the self-reported value in Field 31.",http://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/ukb/field.cgi?id=22001
